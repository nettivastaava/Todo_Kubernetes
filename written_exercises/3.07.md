# ex 3.07

I chose to keep up with Postgres with PersistentVolumeClaims. The main reason for this is that I didn't have to do much to configure it and there's not much time left to complete the remaining exercises. Since I'm going to have a lot of credits left after the course, I'm planning to try Google Cloud SQL at some other time.
